# Youth camp dashboard

This repo contains the protocols to interact with Airtable data and a streamlit app to keep track of the historical behavior of payments, inscriptions and money transfers related to our youth camp.

## How to run the app

First, you need to make sure you have `python3.11` and poetry installed:

```sh
pip install poetry
```

After that, a new virtual environment will be created containing the dependencies to run this app. Once this is done, do this:

```sh
poetry run src/app/app.py
```

And that's it! A new browser session will be opened with the app running.
